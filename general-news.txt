It is acceptable for this server application to support only a restricted subset of HTTP, such as GET or POST requests, and the only headers it must support are Content-Type and Content-Length.Update: Many applicants are misunderstanding and submitting web services and web applications instead of web servers. Please note that this problem is about designing a web server like Apache or Nginx, not a web application."
